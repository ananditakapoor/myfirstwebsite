    <p>Hi! I am Anandita and welcome to my personal website.<br>
        While I love what I'm studying at school (law), I realised that 
        I also have a passion for web development. In 2022, I joined an 
        introductory Python course and soon after that ended, I started the Odin 
        Project. As of now, creating websites is an enjoyable hobby but I am excited
        to see where this may take me once I am more advanced!<br>
        Aside from that, I love reading, I play the piano and 
        it's easier for me to name the countries I <em>haven't</em> visited 
        as opposed to those which I have!
