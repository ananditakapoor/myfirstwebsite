                <p>Hi! I am Anandita and welcome to my personal website.<br>
                    While I love what I'm studying at school (law), I realised that 
                    I also have a passion for web development. In 2022, I joined an 
                    introductory Python course and soon after that ended, I started the Odin 
                    Project. As of now, creating websites is an enjoyable hobby but I am excited
                    to see where this may take me once I am more advanced!<br>
                    Aside from that, I love reading, I play the piano and 
                    it's easier for me to name the countries I <em>haven't</em> visited 
                    as opposed to those which I have!
